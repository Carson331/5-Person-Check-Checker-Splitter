# N-Person-Check-Checker-Splitter
This is my from-scratch programmed calculator app that my friends and I use to divide checks. We take in a dictionary of n-amount of names (probably can be infinite I guess but maybe I am wrong) paired with the subtotal value of what they ordered. Then a function figures out how much of the tax, tip, or delivery fees cost precisely per person and adds that to their subtotal, giving their totals as a list that corresponds to the initial dictionary in index size and order.
